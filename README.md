## ðŸ§© The Problem

Despite contributing **over 25% of Nigeriaâ€™s GDP**, agriculture remains fragmented and inefficient:

- **No access to credit:** Farmers canâ€™t get loans because paper-based warehouse receipts are untrustworthy.
- **Post-harvest losses:** Up to **50% of produce** is wasted due to lack of storage and financing.
- **Market exploitation:** Middlemen capture most of the value, while farmers earn little.
- **Widespread fraud:** Fake receipts and double financing erode trust among banks and warehouses.
- **Low connectivity:** Rural farmers often rely on basic phones and have limited digital literacy.
