## Core Features:

- Immutable Receipt Generation: Generate blockchain-anchored digital receipts upon warehouse deposit, ensuring data integrity and trust. Each receipt records crop details (type, quantity, quality, origin, timestamp, and custody trail), ensuring data integrity, traceability, and tamper-proof ownership records.

- Traceability and Provenance Tracking: Track the provenance of agricultural products from farm to market, providing transparency and building trust with consumers.
- Secure Storage & Marketplace Access: Facilitate access to secure storage facilities and a digital marketplace for farmers to: Store produce securely, Tokenize and list verified receipts for sale, Connect directly to buyers, processors, and exporters (So they are able to sell their produce at fair prices). Smart contracts handle escrow payments and auto-release funds after verified delivery.
- Mobile-First UI with USSD/SMS Fallback: Develop a mobile-first UI with USSD/SMS fallback options for feature phone users and those with intermittent connectivity.
- Fraud Detection Tool: Leverage generative AI to analyze receipt data and identify potentially fraudulent records by checking inconsistencies in the metadata and user data. The system will use external data sources as a tool for validation.
- Smart Contract–Powered Escrow & Payment Automation: Integrate smart contracts that hold buyer payments in escrow until verification of delivery, then automatically release funds to the seller or lender. (Supports multi-party transactions (farmer → warehouse → buyer → lender) with guaranteed fairness and transparency.)
